Notice that this algorithm is based on probability and luck, basically what I mean is:<br>
if you are lucky it will solve it quickly and if you aren't it will just take some time.

## How to use
Press `spacebar` to advance to next state. Hold it if you want to go fast.

## Compile and run
```console
$ cargo run -- ./samples/sudoku1.txt
```
